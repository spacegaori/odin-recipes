<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    The secret to this simple grilled chicken is
    a very powerful marinade and 'roasting' it
    slowly over semi-indirect heat on the grill.
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed or very finely minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
    <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
    <li>6 chicken leg quarters</li>
    <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Whisk garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes,
        black pepper, lemon juice, olive oil, and
        vinegar together in a large bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make 2 slashes on the skin side down to the
        bone in the thigh section and 1 in the leg
        section of each leg quarter. This will help
        infuse pieces with marinade and allow faster
        cooking on the grill. Season both sides of
        chicken generously with kosher salt. Transfer
        to bowl with marinade and thoroughly coat all
        sides. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 4
        to 12 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer chicken to paper-towel-lined sheet
        pan to drain slightly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place leg quarters on grill skin side down
        over semi-direct heat (avoid intense direct
        heat so chicken cooks evenly and skin doesn't
        burn). Cook 6 or 7 minutes. Turn chicken and
        cook another 6 to 7 minutes. Continue cooking
        and turning until internal temperature reaches
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 8 to 10 more
        minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.

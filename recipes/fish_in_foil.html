<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Baked fish in foil is a "no-smell" fish recipe,
    and the only one I make for my family (I hate
    fish, they love it!). Take foil packets to the
    table for service, and keep the packets around
    for wrapping and discarding bones and skin. Then
    when dinner's done, haul those babies to the
    outside trash.

<p>
    This dish is packed with veggies, beef, and saucy
    flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks
    all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles,
    this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 rainbow trout fillets</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 sheets heavy-duty aluminum foil</li>
    <li>1 fresh jalapeno pepper, sliced</li>
    <li>1 lemon, sliced</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>
        Rinse and pat fillets dry. Rub fillets with
        olive oil, and season with garlic salt and
        black pepper. Place each fillet on a large
        sheet of aluminum foil. Top with jalapeno
        slices, and squeeze the juice from the ends
        of the lemon over fillets. Arrange remaining
        lemon slices on top of fillets.
    </li>
    <li>
        Carefully seal all edges of the foil to form
        enclosed packets. Place packets on a baking
        sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes
        easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes depending
        on size of fillets.
    </li>
</ol>
